# Credit card clustering
This project was created as a study of Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques (Clustering & PCA) in Python. The idea was to bring a little more theory about model building and some visualization possibilities to create a report.

The analytical part of the results I left for next time. You will see that the Kmeans technique was applied, which makes this an iterative process. What does this mean? That the result of your code should be different, even with the same settings.

That is all. Send me corrections and suggestions for improvement. 
All collaboration is very welcome.

Have fun! :-)
