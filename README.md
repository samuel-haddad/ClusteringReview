# Clustering Review
This project is an Unsupervised Machine Learning study with Python (Clustering & PCA). The focus was to further discuss the theories behind these models and present some visualization ideas.

You will see that the Kmeans technique was used, which makes this process iterative. What is the implication of this? That the results of your code might be a little different even with the same settings.

Finally, don't hesitate to send me tweaks and improvement suggestions.
Any collaboration is welcome.

Have fun! :-)
